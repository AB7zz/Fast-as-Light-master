Changes we made to our project design: 
- Instead of possibly spawning clouds every three seconds, our team chose to spawn a maximum of 
  seven clouds with varying speeds at all times in a playthrough to make the game more visually
  appealing and challenging.

- Our team also chose to change the time that the background changes, so the background of a game
  playthrough changes a lot more frequently now.

Incomplete features:
- No game audio
- No game mute/unmute audio option for the 'Settings' screen.
- Choosing a character during the sign up process. Instead, all newly created profiles will
  have the blue player character as their starting character.

Valid login information for one of the profiles that we made:
email: fal_user@email.com
password: 12345
